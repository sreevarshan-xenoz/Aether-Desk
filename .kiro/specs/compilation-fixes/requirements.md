# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Aether-Desk project currently has 61 compilation errors preventing it from building successfully. These errors span multiple areas including async/await handling, missing error variants, incomplete trait implementations, UI framework compatibility issues, and various import/type mismatches. This feature will systematically resolve all compilation errors to restore the project to a buildable state while maintaining existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project to compile without errors, so that I can build and run the application successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is built with `cargo build` THEN the system SHALL complete compilation without any errors
2. WHEN the project is built THEN the system SHALL produce no more than 5 warnings (down from current 26)
3. WHEN the compilation is successful THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper async/await handling throughout the codebase, so that asynchronous operations work correctly without blocking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN wallpaper manager methods are called THEN the system SHALL properly handle async operations with await
2. WHEN wallpaper start/stop methods are invoked THEN the system SHALL use async function signatures
3. WHEN mutex locks are used in async contexts THEN the system SHALL use proper async mutex handling
4. WHEN async trait methods are implemented THEN the system SHALL include proper async_trait annotations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want complete error handling with all necessary error variants, so that the application can properly report and handle different types of errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN platform-specific errors occur THEN the system SHALL have a `Platform` variant in AppError
2. WHEN wallpaper-related errors occur THEN the system SHALL have a `Wallpaper` variant in AppError
3. WHEN errors are created THEN the system SHALL use the correct error variant for the error type
4. WHEN error handling is implemented THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent error reporting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all trait implementations to be complete and correct, so that the wallpaper manager works across all supported platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WallpaperManager trait is implemented THEN the system SHALL include all required methods including `get_current_wallpaper`
2. WHEN async trait methods are implemented THEN the system SHALL have matching lifetime parameters
3. WHEN platform-specific implementations are provided THEN the system SHALL correctly implement all trait methods
4. WHEN trait bounds are specified THEN the system SHALL satisfy all required trait bounds

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the UI code to be compatible with the current egui version, so that the graphical interface renders and functions correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UI components are created THEN the system SHALL use current egui API methods
2. WHEN window options are configured THEN the system SHALL use valid NativeOptions fields
3. WHEN UI styling is applied THEN the system SHALL use available egui styling methods
4. WHEN widget configurations are created THEN the system SHALL include all required fields

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper import statements and type handling, so that all modules can access required functionality without conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modules import dependencies THEN the system SHALL only import used items
2. WHEN types are used THEN the system SHALL have proper trait imports in scope
3. WHEN generic types are specified THEN the system SHALL satisfy all trait bounds
4. WHEN borrowed values are used THEN the system SHALL have appropriate lifetimes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper memory management and borrowing, so that the application runs safely without memory issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mutable and immutable borrows are used THEN the system SHALL avoid borrow checker conflicts
2. WHEN temporary values are created THEN the system SHALL ensure proper lifetimes
3. WHEN mutex guards are used THEN the system SHALL avoid deadlocks and borrow conflicts
4. WHEN cloning is needed THEN the system SHALL implement or use appropriate clone methods

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want platform-specific code to handle OS differences correctly, so that the wallpaper functionality works on Windows and Linux.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN platform-specific commands are executed THEN the system SHALL use correct argument types
2. WHEN OS-specific APIs are called THEN the system SHALL handle platform differences appropriately
3. WHEN file paths are processed THEN the system SHALL convert types correctly for system calls
4. WHEN desktop environments are detected THEN the system SHALL use appropriate wallpaper setting methods
